/* Check-in codes.

   What a sticker on a machine carries, whether it is read as a printed QR
   code or off an NFC tag: an ordinary link to this app that names the
   arcade and the game, and nothing else.

     https://arcade-circle.vercel.app/?checkin=koko-town-hall&game=maimai

   It is a plain https link on purpose. That is the one thing every phone
   already knows what to do with: the iPhone camera, Android's camera and
   Lens, and both systems' own NFC readers all open it in the browser
   without this app being open first, which is what lets a player who has
   never launched it today still join with one scan or one tap. (iPhones
   from the XS on read the tag in the background and offer the link as a
   notification; Android opens it, or asks once, depending on version.)
   The app reads the two parameters when the page opens and joins that
   queue with the account signed in to that browser. It is not always
   the one the player uses: the phone opens links in the browser, never
   in a Home Screen copy of the app, and on an iPhone the two keep
   separate sign-ins. So a link that arrives signed out is held through
   signing in and used straight after (lib/pendingCheckIn.js). The same
   link read inside the app - its own viewfinder, or Web NFC on Android -
   goes through the same two functions below, so a code that works one way
   works the other.

   Nothing in the link is a secret and nothing in it identifies a person.
   It is the physical scan that says you are standing at the machine, as
   the field study asked (finding C); a link is no stronger proof than the
   sticker it was printed on, and the prototype does not pretend otherwise.

   The parameters are deliberately not called `code`: the auth client reads
   a `code` parameter on page load as a sign-in callback.

   Kept free of the browser and of Vite, so it runs under plain Node with
   the other rules in this folder. */
